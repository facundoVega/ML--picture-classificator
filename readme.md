# 🧠 VanillaJS Image Classifier

A minimalist image classifier built with **pure JavaScript**. No frameworks. No libraries. Just pixels, math, and browser grit.

## ⚡ What It Does

- Loads images via `<canvas>`
- Extracts pixel features
- Classifies using handcrafted logic

## 🧪 Why It Exists

To prove you don’t need TensorFlow to teach a browser how to think.  
This is ML stripped to the bones — fast, and educational.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo. Open `index.html`. Start training.  
No build steps. No installs. Just code.

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

- Feature extraction: grayscale, histograms, etc.
- Classification: distance-based matching
- Storage: in-memory (for now)
